Some parts of this year leave a mark on the reader's mind, I think the mark will be removed.How much are we able to give in the Islamic religion that we have received in inheritance? The question remains with us. Moreover, how much disrespect are we showing to the rules of Islam by being Muslim... Hopefully, reading the book will make us think about it, InshaAllah.",

This book provides a complete understanding of Hijab which will inform us about the basics of Hijab.The book is written in very simple and easy language. Language has no complications. Which we can easily understand.I would say my brothers must also read the book. Then they can warn their mothers, sisters and wives about hijab",
