Which we can easily understand.I would say my brothers must also read the book. Then they can warn their mothers, sisters and wives about hijab",

Some parts of this year leave a mark on the reader's mind, I think the mark will be removed.How much are we able to give in the Islamic religion that we have received in inheritance? The question remains with us. Moreover, how much disrespect are we showing to the rules of Islam by being Muslim... Hopefully, reading the book will make us think about it, InshaAllah.",
